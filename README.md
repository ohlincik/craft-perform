## PerForm Overview

PerForm is bult for **Craft CMS web developers** with ultimate flexibility in mind. The goal is to let you build the web form front-end anyway you'd like while following a handful of simple conventions. After you include the web form in your Twig template, the plugin will assist you with the following:

* Client-side form validation using [Parsley](http://parsleyjs.org/)
* Spam protection using the [Google Invisible ReCaptcha](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/docs/invisible)
* Saving the form submissions in the Control Panel for future reference
* Delivering the form submission content via email (built-in testing using [mailtrap](https://mailtrap.io/))
